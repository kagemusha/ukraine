        <p>Written by a Ukranian soldier, this song has a simple answer to many questions

            &nbsp;&nbsp;The occupiers came to us in Ukraine<br/>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;in brand new uniform and military vehicles,<br/>

            <br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;Bayraktar...
        </p>

            Catchy tune, punchy lyrics, and great footage  of

            hear me using Ukrainian words, don't ask me if I'm from Lviv. Presumably this will
